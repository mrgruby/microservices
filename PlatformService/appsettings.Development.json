  //This conString is to trick EF to be able to add migrations. EF thinks we are using an inMem database, which we in fact are, so we can't
  //add migrations without some tricks. In Program.cs, we call the seed method in PrepDb.cs, and this will try to run migrations on the 
  //database. So we need to temporarily comment out that call. Also, because EF thinks we are running locally, it will look in this file for 
  //a connectionstring, so we need to add this: All this could be avoided by using SQL Server instead of inMem, which is also preferred.
